# Weather App

A dynamic Weather Application that allows users to search for weather data in different places, bookmark favorite locations, and view them later. The app stores user preferences and bookmarks locally using SharedPreferences, ensuring data persistence even after closing the app. The user interface dynamically adapts based on weather conditions.
